## 1. Business Questions

A company aims to evaluate its CRM data and sales pipeline for leads registered over the last five months. The task is to build a comprehensive analytic report that provides insights into lead distribution across countries, industries, and organization sizes. The report assesses the health of the sales pipeline, forecasts potential income over the next few months, and compares sales agent performance.

1. Who are the top-performing sales agents?

2. What are the conversion rates for leads to paying customers in different countries?
   
3. How does the sales performance vary across different industries?

4. How healthy is the sales pipeline month-over-month, considering the number of leads at each stage of the sales funnel?
  
5. What is the average time taken by sales agents to respond to new leads, and how does it impact conversion rates?

6. What are the trends in the average deal values? Are there noticeable fluctuations?

7. Based on current pipeline data and historical trends, forecast potential income for the next few months. What factors are considered in your forecasting model?

8. Does the size of the organization affect the sales cycle duration and deal value?

9. How effective are sales strategies for different products offered (e.g., SAAS vs. other product types)? Compare the deal closure rates and values between products.

10. Assess the time taken from lead acquisition to deal closure. Which factors (country, industry, agent) influence the duration of the sales cycle?
